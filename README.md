# Advent of Code - 2022

### Summary
Since 2015, Advent of Code has been an annual event featuring Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that coincide with the Advent calendar. These challenges cater to a wide range of skill sets and levels, and participants are free to solve them using any programming language.

In this repository I have a collection of jupyter notebooks with my attempts at solving the problems in python.
